I can't believe how much I hate \nPressures of a new place roll my way
Jumpsuit, jumpsuit, cover me!
I crumble underneath the weight \nPressures of a new place roll my way
Spirits in my room, friend or foe? \nFelt it in my youth, feel it when I'm old
Dusting off my jumpsuit (Cover me)
I'll be right there \n But you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
If you need anyone, I'll stop my plans \nBut you'll have to tie me down and then break both my hands
If you need anyone, I'll be right there \nBut you'll have to grab my throat and lift me in the air
Oh, I know how to levitate up off my feet \nAnd ever since the seventh grade I learned to fire-breathe
And though I feed on things that fell \nYou can learn to levitate with just a little help
Cowards only come through when the hour's late \nAnd everyone's asleep, mind you
I know I shouldn't say this \nBut a curse from you is all that I would need right now, man
Danger in the fabric of this thing I made \nI probably shouldn't show you, but it's way too late
My heart is with you hiding, but my mind's not made \nNow they know it like we both knew for some time I'd say
They're smirking at fresh blood, they're circling above \nBut this is not enough, yeah, this is not what you thought
No, no, we are not just graffiti on a passing train
I got back what I once bought back \nIn that slot, I won't need to replace
This culture is a poacher of overexposure, not today \nDon't feed me to the vultures, I am a vulture who feeds on pain
Sleep in a well-lit room, don't let the shadow through
And sever all I knew, yeah, \nsever all I thought I could depend on my weekends \nOn the freezing ground that I'm sleeping on
Please, keep me from, please keep me down from the ledges \nBetter test it, wooden wedges under doorways
Wait, habits here too, you’re the worst, your structure compensates
But compensation feels a lot like rising up to dominate by track two \nAt least they all know all they hear comes from a place
Welcome to Trench
Can't stop thinking about if and when I die \nFor now I see that "if" and "when" are truly different cries \nFor "if" is purely panic and "when" is solemn sorrow \nAnd one invades today while the other spies tomorrow
We're surrounded and we're hounded \nThere's no above, or under, or around it
For "above" is blind belief and "under" is sword to sleeve \nAnd "around" is scientific miracle, let's pick "above" and see
For if and when we go above, the question still remains \nAre we still in love and is it possible we feel the same? \nAnd that's when goin' under starts to take my wonder
But until that time, I'll try to sing this \nIf I keep moving, they won't know \nI'll morph to someone else
What they throw at me's too slow \nI'll morph to someone else \nI'm just a ghost
I'll morph to someone else \nA defense mechanism mode
He'll always try to stop me, that Nicolas Bourbaki \nHe's got no friends close but those who know him most know \nHe goes by Nico, he told me I'm a copy \nWhen I'd hear him mock me, that's almost stopped me
Well, we're surrounded and we're hounded \nThere's no above or a secret door
What are we here for \nIf not to run straight through all our tormentors?
Lights, they blink to me, transmitting things to me \nOnes and zeroes, ergo this symphony
Anybody listening? Ones and zeroes \nCount to infinity, ones and zeroes
I'm surrounded and I'm hounded \nThere's no above, or under, or around it
Not done, not done \nNot done, Josh Dun
I'll morph to someone else
When everyone you thought you knew \nDeserts your fight, I'll go with you
You're facin' down a dark hall \nI'll grab my light \nAnd go with you
Surrounded and up against a wall \nI'll shred 'em all and go with you
When choices end, you must defend \nI'll grab my bat \nAnd go with you
Stay with me, no, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood, you don't need to run
If there comes a day \nPeople posted up at the end of your driveway \nThey're callin' for your head and they're callin' for your name \nI'll bomb down on 'em, I'm comin' through
Did they know I was grown with you? \nIf they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
If you find yourself in a lion's den \nI'll jump right in and pull my pin
So, where are ya? It's been a little while
Sippin' on straight chlorine \nLet the vibe slide over me
When I leave, don't save my seat \nI'll be back when it's all complete
Lovin' what I'm tastin' \nVenom on my tongue, dependent at times
Poisonous vibrations, help my body run, \nI'm runnin' for my life
Fall out of formation, \nI plan my escape from walls they confined
Rebel red carnation, \nGrows while I decay
Hide you in my coat pocket, where I kept my rebel red \nI felt I was invincible, you wrapped around my head
Now different lives I lead, my body lives on lead \nThe last two lines may read incorrect until said
The lead is terrible in flavor \nBut now you double as a paper maker
I despise you sometimes, I love to hate the fight \nAnd you in my life is like \nSippin' on straight chlorine
I'm so sorry I forgot you \nLet me catch you up to speed
I've been tested like the ends of a weathered flag that's by the sea
Can you build my house with pieces? \nI'm just a chemical
I've always been collected, calm and chill \nI never look for conflict for the thrill
If I’m feeling \nSomeone stepping towards you, can't describe \nJust what I'm feeling
For you, I’d go \nStep to a dude much bigger than me
For you, I know \nI would get messed up, weigh 153
For you \nI would get beat to smithereens
You know \nI'll be in the corner taking notes \nAnd you know \nI got your six while you're working votes
You know I had to do one on the record for her like this
For you, I'd go \nWrite a slick song just to show you the world
For you, I know \nThey think it’s messed up to sell out for your girl
What's my problem? \nWell, I want you to follow me down to the bottom \nUnderneath the insane asylum
Keep your wits about you while you got 'em \n'Cause your wits are first to go while you're problem-solvin'
And my problem? \nWe glorify those even more when they...
My opinion, our culture can treat a loss like it's a win \nAnd right before we turn on them \nWe give 'em the highest of praise \nAnd hang their banner from the ceiling
Communicating, further engraving \nAn earlier grave is an optional way, no
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones 
What's my problem? \nDon't get it twisted \nIt's with the people we praise who may have assisted
I could use the streams and extra conversations \nI could give up, and boost up my reputation \nI could go out with a bang
They would know my name \nThey would host and post a celebration
My opinion will not be lenient \nMy opinion, it's real convenient
Our words are loud, but now I'm talking action
We don't get enough love? \nWell, they get a fraction
They say, "How could he go if he's got everything? \nI'll mourn for a kid, but won't cry for a king"
Promise me this \nIf I lose to myself \nYou won't mourn a day \nAnd you'll move onto someone else
Neon gravestones try to call for my bones \n'Cause they won't get them
Don't get me wrong, the rise in awareness \nIs beating a stigma that no longer scares us \nBut for sake of discussion, in spirit of fairness \nCould we give this some room for a new point of view?
And could it be true that some could be tempted \nTo use this mistake as a form of aggression? \nA form of succession? \nA form of a weapon? \nThinking "I'll teach them", well, I'm refusing the lesson
It won't resonate in our minds \nI'm not disrespecting what was left behind \nJust pleading that it does not get glorified
Maybe we swap out what it is that we hold so high
Find your grandparents or someone of age \nPay some respects for the path that they paved
To life, they were dedicated \nNow, that should be celebrated
Sometimes I feel cold, even paralyzed \nMy interior world needs to sanitize
I've got to step through or I’ll dissipate \nI'll record my step through for my basement tapes
Nice to know my kind will be on my side \nI don't believe the hype
And you know you’re a terrible sight \nBut you'll be just fine \nJust don't believe the hype
Yeah, they might be talking behind your head \nYour exterior world can step off instead
It might take some friends and a warmer shirt \nBut you don't get thick skin without getting burnt
We’re gonna rely pretty heavily on technology and energy \nTo cover up the fact that we’re only two people \nBut I think we can do it
No, I don't know which way I’m going \nBut I can hear my way around
Msilaiv ecnuoned ew \nTsae eurt daeh dna amed evael lliw uoy \nSotidnab era ew
East is up, I'm fearless when I hear this on the low
East is up, I'm careless when I wear my rebel clothes
East is up, when Bishops come together they will know that \nDema don't control us
They want to make you forget \nSave your razorblades now, not yet.
I'm heavy, my jumpsuit is on steady \nI'm lighter when I'm lower, I'm higher when I'm heavy
I'm so high, my Jumpsuit takes me so high \nI'm flying from a fire, from Nico and the Niners
What I say when I want to be enough \nWhat a beautiful day for making a break for it
We'll find a way to pay for it \nMaybe from all the money we made razorblade stores
Rent a racehorse and force a sponsor \nAnd start a concert, a complete diversion
Start a mob and you can be quite certain \nWe'll win but not everyone will get out
We'll win but not everyone will get out \nNo, no
I'll keep on tryin’, might as well \nIf you decide all is well
Though I am bruised, face of contusions \nKnow I’ll keep movin'
Rust around the rim, drink it anyway \nI cut my lip \nIsn't what I want, blood is on my tongue
I keep on goin' back \nEven though it’s me I abuse \nI’ll keep on goin' back even...
I don't mind at all, lean on my pride \nLean on my pride, I'm a lion
I could take the high road \nBut I know that I'm goin' low \nI'm a ban—I'm a bandito
This is the sound we make when in between two places \nWhere we used to bleed and where our blood needs to be
In City, I feel my spirit is contained \nLike neon inside the glass, they form my brain \nBut I recently discovered it's a heatless fire
Like nicknames they give themselves to uninspire \nBegin with bullet, now add fire to the proof
I'm still not sure if fear's a rival or close relative to truth \nEither way it helps to hear these words bounce off of you \nThe softest echo could be enough for me to make it through
Folina, Sahlo Folina \nSahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina
I created this world to feel some control \nDestroy it if I want \nSo I sing Sahlo Folina, Sahlo Folina, Sahlo
I am on an island, no one to confide \nEight days straight, eight hours each and not one line
I can feel pressure start to possess my mind \nSo, I'll take this beat I should delete to exercise
No, I move slow, I want to stop time \nI'll sit here 'til I find the problem
I've got a pet cheetah down in my basement \nI've raised him, and bathed him, and named him Jason
Statham, I've trained him to make me these beats \nNow my pet cheetah's quicker in the studio than on his feet
I'ma get mine and get going \nI'm showing my faces in just enough places
I'm done with tip-toeing, I'll stay in my room \nMy house is the one where the vultures are perched on the roof
Get behind me, I bet this nepotistic mindset \nWill help us get ours as we're growing
This clique means so much to this dude \nIt could make him afraid of his music and be scared to death he could lose it
You were one of those classic ones \nTraveling around this sun, I wish she knew you
You were one of those classic ones \nNow everybody knows
Alright you're a legend in my own mind, my middle name, my goodbye
You were here when I wrote this \nBut the masters and mixes will take too long to finish to show you
I'm sorry I did not visit \vDid not know how to take it v\When your eyes did not know me like I know you
Then the day that it happened, I recorded this last bit \nI look forward to having a lunch with you again
I'm tired of tending to this fire \nI've used up all I've collected \nI have singed my hands
It's glowing, embers barely showing \nProof of life in the shadows \nDancing on my plans
They know that it's almost \nThey know that it's almost over
The burning is so low it's concerning \n'Cause they know that when it goes out \nIt's a glorious gone
It's only time before they show me \nWhy no one ever comes back \nWith details from beyond
In time, I will leave the city \nFor now, I will stay alive
Last year I needed change of pace \nCouldn't take the pace of change \nMoving hastily \nBut this year, though I'm far from home \nIn Trench I'm not alone \nThese faces facin' me
They know, \nThey know, \nWhat I mean
There's an infestation in my mind's imagination  \nI hope that they choke on smoke 'cause I'm smokin' them out the basement
This is not rap, this is not hip-hop \nJust another attempt to make the voices stop
Rappin' to prove nothin', just writin' to say somethin' \n'Cause I wasn't the only one who wasn't rushin' to sayin' nothin'
This doesn't mean I lost my dream \nIt's just right now I got a really crazy mind to clean
Gangsters don't cry, therefore, therefore I'm Mr. Misty-eyed
Can you save, can you save my \nCan you save my heavydirtysoul? \nFor me?
Nah, I didn't understand a thing you said \nIf I didn't know better, I'd guess you're all already dead \nMindless zombies walkin' around with a limp an' a hunch \nSayin' stuff like, "You only live once"
You've got one time to figure it out \nOne time to twist and one time to shout \nOne time to think and I say we start now \nSing it with me if you know what I'm talkin' about
Death inspires me like a dog inspires a rabbit
I wish I found some better sounds no one's ever heard
I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sang
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink \nBut now I'm insecure, an' I care what people think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
Wish we could turn back time to the good old days, when our momma sang us to sleep, but now we're stressed out
Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young \nHow come I'm never able to identify where it's comin' from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it \nTry to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose \nSame clothes, homegrown, a stone's throw from a creek we used to roam \nBut it would remind us of when nothing really mattered 
Out of student loans and treehouse homes, we all would take the latter
My-my-my name's Blurryface and I care what you think
We used to play pretend, give each other different names
We would build a rocket ship an' then we'd fly it far away \nUsed to dream of outer space, but now they're laughin' at our face \nSayin', "Wake up, you need to make money!"
I just wanna stay in the sun where I find \nPieces of peace in the sun's peace of mind \nI know it's hard sometimes
Yeah, I think about the end just way too much but it's fun to fantasize
On my enemies I wouldn't wish who I was but it's fun to fantasize
I'm fallin', so I'm takin' my time on my ride \nTakin' my time on my ride
"I'd die for you," that's easy to say
We have a list of people that we would take \nA bullet for them, a bullet for you \nA bullet for everybody in this room but I don't seem to see many bullets comin' through
Metaphorically, I'm the man \nBut literally, I don't know what I'd do
"I'd live for you," and that's hard to do \nEven harder to say when you know it's not true \nEven harder to write when you know that tonight there were people back home who tried talkin' to you \nBut then you ignore them still
All these questions they're for real \nLike who would you live for? Who would you die for? \nAnd would you ever kill?
I've been thinkin' too much \nI've been thinkin' too much \nI've been thinkin' too much \nHelp me
I'm fairly local, I've been around \nI've seen the streets you're walkin' down
I'm fairly local, good people now
I'm evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will \nThey say I'm emotional, what I want to save I'll kill
Is that who I truly am? I truly don't have a chance \nTomorrow I'll keep a beat an' repeat yesterday's dance
Yo, this song will never be on the radio \nEven if my clique were to pick an' the people were to vote \nIt's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral \nThe world around us is burnin' but we're so cold \nIt's the few, the proud, an' the emotional
I'm not evil to the core, what I shouldn't do I will fight \nI know I'm emotional, what I wanna save I will try
I know who I truly am, I truly do have a chance \nTomorrow I'll switch the beat to avoid yesterday's dance
An-nyŏng-ha-se-yo
Sometimes you gotta bleed to know, that you're alive and have a soul
It takes someone to come around to show you how she's the tear in my heart
She's the tear in my heart, I'm on fire
She's the tear in my heart, take me higher \nThan I've ever been
The songs on the radio are okay but my taste in music is your face \nAn' it takes a song to come around to show you how she's the tear in my heart
You fell asleep in my car, I drove the whole time \nBut that's okay, I'll just avoid the holes so you sleep fine
I'm driving here I sit, cursing my government \nFor not usin' my taxes to fill holes with more cement
My heart is my armor, she's the tear in my heart, she's a carver \nShe's a butcher with a smile, cut me farther \nThan I've ever been
They say, "Stay in your lane, boy, lane, boy" but we go where we want to
They think this thing is a highway, highway, but will they be alive tomorrow?
They think this thing is a highway \nIf it was our way, we'd have a tempo change every other time change \n'Cause our mind's changed on what we think is good
I wasn't raised in the hood \nBut I know a thing or two about pain an' darkness
If it wasn't for this music I don't know how I would have fought this
Regardless, all these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless
Honest, \nThere's a few songs on this record that feel common
I'm in constant confrontation with what I want and what is poppin' in the industry, \nIt seems to me that singles on the radio are currency
My creativity's only free when I'm playin' shows
I'm sorry if that question I asked last scared you a bit like a Hazmat, in a gas mask if you ask Zack \nHe's my brother, he likes when I rap fast
Let's backtrack, back to this \nWho would you live and die for on that list? \nBut the problem is, there's another list that exists and no one really wants to think about this
Forget sanity, forget salary, forget vanity, my morality \nIf you get in between someone I love and me \nYou're gonna feel the heat of my cavalry
All these songs I'm hearin' are so heartless \nDon't trust a perfect person and don't trust a song that's flawless
When the leader of the bad guys sang something soft and soaked in pain \nI heard the echo from his secret hideaway
He must've forgot to close his door \nAs he cranked out those dismal chords \nAnd his four walls declared him insane
I found my way \nRight time, wrong place \nAs I pled my case
You're the judge, oh no \nSet me free
I know my soul's freezing \nHell's hot for good reason \nSo please, take me
Three lights are lit, but the fourth one's out \nI can tell 'cause it's a bit darker than the last night's bout
I forgot about the drought of light bulbs in this house \nSo I head out down a route I think is heading south
I'm not good with directions and I hide behind my mouth \nI'm a pro at imperfections and I'm best friends with my doubt
And now that my mind's out and now I hear it clear and loud \nI'm thinking "Wow, I probably should've stayed inside my house."
I don't know if this song \nIs a surrender or a revel \nI don't know if this one \nIs about me or the devil
Scared of my own image, scared of my own immaturity \nScared of my own ceiling, scared I'll die of uncertainty
Fear might be the death of me, fear leads to anxiety \nDon’t know what’s inside of me
Don't forget about me even when I doubt you \nI'm no good without you, no, no
Temperature is dropping, temperature is dropping \nI'm not sure if I can see this ever stopping
Shaking hands with the dark parts of my thoughts, \nYou are all that I’ve got
Gnawing on the bishops, claw our way up their system \nRepeating simple phrases, someone holy insisted
Want the markings made on my skin \nTo mean something to me again
Hope you haven't left without me, please
Help me polarize, help me down \nThose stairs is where I'll be hidin' all my problems
Help me polarize, help me out \nMy friends and I, we got a lot of problems
You know where I'm coming from \nThough I am running to you \nAll I feel is denial
I wanted to be a better brother, better son \nWanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done \nI have none to show to the one I love but denial
Polarize is taking your disguises \nSeparating 'em, splitting 'em up from wrong and right \nIt's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight denial
Domingo en fuego
Domingo en fuego \nI think I lost my halo \nI don't know where you are, you'll have to come and find me
We don't believe what's on TV because it's what we want to see \nAnd what we want we know we can't believe \nWe have all learned to kill our dreams
I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here, \n'Cause if you stick around, I'll sing you pretty sounds
I don't care what's in your hair \nI just wanna know what's on your mind
I used to say I wanna die before I'm old \nBut because of you, I might think twice
What if my dream does not happen? \nWould I just change what I've told my friends? \nDon't want to know who I would be \nWhen I wake up from a dreamer's sleep
A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise \nAnd who I am today is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done \nI'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run \nSo I'm takin' this moment to live in the future
Release me from the present, I'm obsessin', all these questions \nWhy I'm in denial that they tried this suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message, \nthese lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand
You don't know my brain \nThe way you know my name \nYou don't know my heart \nThe way you know my face
Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this \nThey rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets \nWrote this in three minutes, three words to a line \nIt's just poetry divided
I'm the kind of guy who takes every moment he knows he confided in \nMusic to use it for others to use it
You're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
Life is up here but you comment below \nWhen the comments below has become common motivation to promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope is far from this moment \nBut you and I know it gets better when mornin' finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future \nRemember the mornin' is when night is dead
A shadow tilts its head at me \nSpirits in the dark are waiting \nI will let the wind go quietly
Be the one, be the one to take my soul and make it undone \nBe the one, be the one to take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know you can bring the fire, I can bring the bones \nI know, I know you make the fire, my bones will make it grow
Where we're from, there's no sun, our hometown's in the dark \nWhere we're from, we're no one, our hometown's in the dark
Put away, put away all the gods your father served today \nPut away, put away your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know how to put back the power in our soul \nWe don't know, we don't know where to find what once was in our bones
I don't know why I just feel I'm better off \nStayin' in the same room I was born in \nI look outside and see a whole world better off \nWithout me in it tryin' to transform it
You are out of my mind, you aren't seein' my side, \nYou waste all this time tryin' to get to me but you are out of my mind
Listen, I know this one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds \nBut the lyrics are so down
It's okay though because it represents, better yet it is \nWho I feel I am right now
Heard you say, "Not today" \nTore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice" \nTore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise
Oh, don't you test me, no \nJust because I play the piano \nDoesn't mean I, I'm not willin' to take you down \nI'm sorry
I'm, I'm out of my mind, I'm not seein' things right, oh \nI waste all this time tryin' to run from you \nBut I'm, I'm out of my mind
I'm a goner, somebody catch my breath \nI wanna be known by you
Though I'm weak and beaten down \nI'll slip away into the sound
The ghost of you is close to me \nI'm inside out, you're underneath
I've got two faces, Blurry's the one I'm not \nI need your help to take him out
Don't let me be gone \nDon't let me be gone \nDon't let me be! \nDon't let me be! \nOh, yeah!
I wake up fine and dandy \nBut then by the time I find it handy \nTo rip my heart apart and start planning my crash landing \nI go up, up, up, up, up to the ceiling
I feel my soul start leaving \nLike an old man's hair receding \nI'm pleading, "Please, oh please!" on my knees repeatedly asking \nWhy it's got to be like this, Is this living free?
I don't wanna be the one \nBe the one who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon \nTake this weapon, forged in darkness \nSome see a pen, I see a harpoon
I'll stay awake 'cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight
Why am I not scared in the morning? \nI don't hear those voices calling \nI must have kicked them out, I must have kicked them out
I swear I heard demons yelling \nThose crazy words they were spelling \nThey told me I was gone, they told me I was gone
But I tell 'em, "Why won't you let me go? \nDo I threaten all your plans? I'm insignificant"
Please tell 'em, you have no plans for me \nI will set my soul on fire, what have I become? \nI'll tell 'em
On the eve of a day that's forgotten and fake \nAs the trees, they await, and clouds anticipate \nThe start of a day when we put on our face \nA mask that portrays that we don't need grace
On the eve of a day that is bigger than us \nBut we open our eyes, cause we're told that we must \nAnd the trees wave their arms and the clouds try to plead \nDesperately yelling, "There's something we need!"
I'm not free, I asked forgiveness three times \nSame amount that I denied, I three-time MVP'd this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore \nWon't tell you who I'm singing towards \nMetaphorically, I'm a whore, and that's denial number four
I will set my soul on fire, what have I become? I'm sorry
I'm taking over my body, back in control, no more "shotty" \nI bet a lot of me was lost, "T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot like flesh is all I got \nNot any more, flesh out the door, SWAT!
I must've forgot, you can't trust me \nI'm open a moment and closed when you show it \nBefore you know it, I'm lost at sea
And now that I write and think about it and the story unfolds \nYou should take my life, you should take my soul
You are surrounding, all my surroundings \nSounding down the mountain range of my left-side brain \nAnd I'll be holding onto you
You are surrounding, all my surroundings \nTwisting the kaleidoscope behind both of my eyes \nAnd I'll be holding onto you
Remember the moment you know exactly where you're goin' \n'Cause the next moment before you know it \nTime is slowin' and it's frozen still
And the windowsill looks really nice, right? \nYou think twice about your life, it probably happens at night, right?
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it \nTie a noose around your mind, foose enough to breathe fine
And tie it to a tree tell it, "You belong to me \nThis ain't a noose, this is a leash \nAnd I have news for you, you must obey me!"
Lean with it, rock with it, when we gonna stop with it? \nLyrics that mean nothin', we were gifted with thought
Is it time to move our feet, to an introspective beat? \nIt ain't the speakers that bump hearts, it's our hearts that make the beat
Am I the only one I know \nWaging my wars behind my face and above my throat? \nShadows will scream that I'm alone-lone-lone...
I've got a migraine \nAnd my pain will range from up, down, and sideways
Thank God it's Friday 'cause Fridays will always be better than Sundays \n'Cause Sundays are my suicide days
I don't know why they always seem so dismal \nThunderstorms, clouds, snow, and a slight drizzle
Whether it's the weather or the letters by my bed \nSometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Let it be said what the headache represents \nIt's me defending in suspense, it's me suspended in a defenseless test \nBeing tested by a ruthless examinant \nThat's represented best by my depress...ing thoughts
I do not have writer's block, my writer just hates the clock \nIt will not let me sleep, I guess I'll sleep when I'm dead \nAnd sometimes death seems better than the migraine in my head
Am I the only one I know \nWaging my wars behind my face and above my throat? \nShadows will scream that I'm alone \nBut I know, we've made it this far... kid
I am not as fine as I seem, pardon \nMe for yelling, I'm telling you green gardens \nAre not what's growing in my psyche, it's a different me
A difficult beast, feasting on burnt down trees \nFreeze frame, please let me paint a mental picture portrait \nSomething you won't forget, it's all about my forehead
And how it is a door that holds back contents \nThat makes Pandora's box contents look non-violent
Behind my eyelids are islands of violence \nMy mind ship-wrecked, this is the only land my mind could find
I did not know it was such a violent island \nFull of tidal waves, suicidal crazed lions \nThey're trying to eat me, blood running down their chin \nAnd I know that I can fight, or I can let the lion win
I begin to assemble what weapons I can find \n'Cause sometimes to stay alive you gotta kill your mind
And I will say that we should take a day to break away \nFrom all the pain our brain has made, the game is not played alone
And I will say that we should take a moment and hold it \nAnd keep it frozen and know that life has a hopeful undertone
She asked me, "Son, when I grow old \nWill you buy me a house of gold? \nAnd when your father turns to stone \nWill you take care of me?"
I will make you queen of everything you see \nI'll put you on the map, I'll cure you of disease
Let's say we up and left this town \nAnd turned our future upside down \nWe'll make pretend that you and me n\Lived ever after happily
And since we know that dreams are dead \nAnd life turns plans up on their head \nI will plan to be a bum \nSo I just might become someone
I ponder of something great \nMy lungs will fill and then deflate \nThey fill with fire, exhale desire \nI know it's dire, my time today
I have these thoughts so often, I ought \nTo replace that slot with what I once bought n\'Cause somebody stole my car radio \nAnd now I just sit in silence
Sometimes quiet is violent \nI find it hard to hide it, my pride is no longer inside \nIt's on my sleeve, my skin will scream \nReminding me of who I killed inside my dream
I hate this car that I'm driving, there's no hiding for me \nI'm forced to deal with what I feel \nThere is no distraction to mask what is real \nI could pull the steering wheel
I ponder of something terrifying \n'Cause this, time there's no sound to hide behind
I find over the course of our human existence \nOne thing consists of consistence \nAnd it's that we're all battling fear \nOh dear, I don't know if we know why we're here
Oh my, too deep, please stop thinking \nI liked it better when my car had sound
There are things we can do \nBut from the things that work there are only two \nAnd from the two that we choose to do \nPeace will win and fear will lose
And there's faith and there's sleep \nWe need to pick one please because \nFaith is to be awake and to be awake is for us to think
And for us to think is to be alive \nAnd I will try with every rhyme \nTo come across like I am dying \nTo let you know you need to try to think
Night falls, with gravity \nThe earth turns, from sanity \nTaking my only friend I know \nHe leaves a lot, his name is Hope
I'm never what I like \nI'm double-sided
And I just can't hide \nI kinda like it \nWhen I make you cry \n'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside
The horrors of the night melt away \nUnder the warm glow of survival of the day \nThen we move on
My shadow grows taller along with my fears \nAnd my frame shrinks smaller as night grows near
When the sun is climbing window sills \nAnd the silver lining rides the hills \nI will be saved for one whole day \nUntil the sun makes the hills its grave
I'm semi-automatic \nMy prayers schizophrenic \nBut I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down \nAnd shadows burn \nI will rise and stand my ground \nWaiting for the night's return
I do not know why I would go \nIn front of you and hide my soul \n'Cause you're the only one who knows it \nYeah, you're the only one who knows it
And I will hide behind my pride \nI don't know why I think I can lie \n'Cause there's a screen on my chest \nYeah there's a screen on my chest

I'm standing in front of you \nI'm trying to be so cool \nEverything together trying to be so cool \nI'm standing in front of you
I can't see past my own nose \nI'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground \nJust like a vertical locomotive, that's a train \nAm I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane \nMy flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people \nWho know if I flow on a song, I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I \nWho have a really tough time getting through this life \nSo excuse us while we sing to the sky
We're broken, we're broken \nWe're broken, we're broken people
I can't take them on my own, my own \nPa, I'm not the one you know, you know \nI have killed a man and all I know is \nI am on the run and go
Don't wanna call you in the nighttime \nDon't wanna give you all my pieces \nDon't wanna hand you all my trouble \nDon't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle \nFrom several rooms away \nBut tonight, I'll need you to stay
I am up against the wall, the wall \nPa, I hear them coming down the hall \nI have killed a man and all I know is \nI am on the run and go
Cold nights under siege from accusations \nCerebral thunder and one-way conversations \nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I want to drive away \nIn the night, headlights call my name
I, I'll never be, be what you see inside \nYou say I'm not alone, but I am petrified
You say that you are close, is close the closest star? \nYou just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far
And I'll fall, and I'll break \nAnd I'll fake, all I wanna \n(Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey...)
I'm so afraid of what you have to say \n'Cause I am quiet now and silence gives you space
It's the same game today as it always is \nI don't give you space to speak my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines \nThat remind me of all the times... I have committed \nDirty, dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted \nTo what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing and fusing \nAnd believe me, that's what all the kids are doing \nWhat kids are doing, they're killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner cell \nAnd if you're one of them, then you're one of me \nAnd you would do almost anything just to feel free... Am I right?
Of course I am, convince me otherwise, it'll take all night \nBefore you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say \nOur brains are sick but that's okay
Yeah, and I'll fall down, and I'll break down \nAnd I'll fake you out, all I wanna
I know what you think in the morning \nWhen the sun shines on the ground \nAnd shows what you have done
It shows where your mind has gone \nAnd you swear to your parents \nThat it will never happen again \nI know, I know-ow-ow what that means, I know-ow-ow-ow-ow
That you all have guns \nAnd you never put the safety on \nAnd you all have plans \nTo take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep \nBut I can't, but I can't when you all have \nGuns for hands, yeah
Let's take this a second at a time \nLet's take this one song, this one rhyme \nTogether, let's breathe \nTogether, to the beat
But there's hope out the window \nSo that's where we'll go \nLet's go outside and all join hands \nBut until then you'll never understand
We've turned our hands to guns \nTraded our thumbs for ammunition
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition \nCause when the sun sets \nIt upsets what's left of my invested interest \nInterested in putting my fingers to my head
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids \nFused at the wrist \nI simply tell them they should shoot at this \nSimply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's \nObviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist
I know where you stand, silent in the trees \nAnd that's where I am, silent in the trees \nWhy won't you speak where I happen to be? \nSilent in the trees, standing cowardly
I can feel your breath \nI can feel my death \nI want to know you, I want to see \nI want to say \nHello, hello \nHello, oh, hello
Now the night is coming to an end, ooh \nThe sun will rise and we will try again, ooh
Stay alive, stay alive for me \nYou will die, but now your life is free \nTake pride in what is sure to die
I will fear the night again, ooh \nI hope I'm not my only friend, ooh
